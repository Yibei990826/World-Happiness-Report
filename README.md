# World-Happiness-Report
Regression Analysis about world happiness scores
This is a regression project based on the world happiness scores from 2015-2022.
This project is composed of 4 parts:
1. EDA
2. I did the data cleaning and data imputation to impute for missing data and scale the numerical data.
3. Data exploration to find interesting patterns in the data, a naive regression model, and answer some questions.
4. Used Lasso regression, PCA decomposition and stepwise regression to improve the performance of the regression model.
Result: A regression model that has 80% R_square, with 0.24 MSE on test set.
